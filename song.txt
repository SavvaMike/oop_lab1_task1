Cause you make my earth quake
Oh, you make my earth quake
Riding around, your love is shakin' me up and it's making my heart break
'Cause you make my earth quake (earth quake, ooh)
Oh, you make my earth quake
Riding around, your love is shakin' me up and it's making my heart break

Don't leave, it's my fault
Don't leave, it's my fault
Don't leave, it's my fault (yeah)
'Cause when it all comes crashing down I'll need you
